# App Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for PWA installation:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels (for Android home screen)
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels (for Android home screen and splash screen)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
1. Any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.)
2. Online icon generators
3. Your app logo/branding

The icons should be:
- Square (192x192 and 512x512)
- PNG format
- Transparent background (optional but recommended)
- High quality and recognizable at small sizes

## Temporary Solution

For testing, you can use any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images. The app will work without icons, but they won't display properly when installed to home screen.
